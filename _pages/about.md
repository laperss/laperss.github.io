This is the personal webpage of Linnea Persson. I am a PhD Student at the department of Automatic Control since the spring of 2016. My work is done as a part of the Wallenberg Autonomous Systems Project (WASP). I graduated from the degree Programme in Engineering Physics in 2016, with a master in Systems, Control & Robotics.

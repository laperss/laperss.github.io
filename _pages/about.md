This is the personal webpage of Linnea Persson. I am a PhD Student at the division of Decision and Control Systems ([DCS](https://www.kth.se/ac/division-of-decision-and-control-systems)) since May 2016, as a part of the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org/)) under the supervision of Professor Bo Wahlberg.
I graduated from the degree Programme in Engineering Physics in 2016, with a M.Sc in Systems, Control & Robotics. 

My interests include collaborative control, model predictive control, autonomous systems and aerospace applications.

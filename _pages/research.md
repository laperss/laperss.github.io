I am a PhD Student at the Automatic Control Department, within the Wallenberg Autonomous Systems Program, [WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org/) under the supervision of Professor Bo Wahlberg. 
My work here is focused on autonomous vehicle systems from a control perspective. My particular research interests include cooperative control, optimization, flight control, and more.

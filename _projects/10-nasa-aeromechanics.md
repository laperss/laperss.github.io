I had a four months long internship at the rotorcraft division of the [NASA Ames aeromechanics office](https://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/), a division which does research in a wide range of  activities related to vertical lift aircraft.

I worked mainly with conceptual design analysis of experimental rotorcraft configuration, including stability and control analysis of a novel experimental tiltrotor concept. I used the tool NDARC developed at NASA for the  aircraft system analysis.

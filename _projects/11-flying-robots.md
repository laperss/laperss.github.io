During my master thesis I joined the Flying Robots Group at the Robotics and Mechatronics Center at DLR Oberpfaffenhofen in their project on high-altitude long-endurance UAVs. 
The objective with the project was to use cooperative control to safely land a fixed-wing UAV on top of a ground vehicle. 
My work included control design and evaluation as well as participation in flight experiments and flight data analysis. 

A BBC video explainging the experiment can be found [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35351709).

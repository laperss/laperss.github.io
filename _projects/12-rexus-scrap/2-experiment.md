The scientific objective of the SCRAP experiment was to verify theories on electron density fluctuations in dusty plasmas.
This is done by creating an artificial cloud of conducting micro particles in the mesosphere. 

The rocket ejects two free falling units (FFUs) which each subsequently releases a cloud of conductive microparticles into the mesosphere. 
The particle cloud will interact with the surrounding plasma and can thereafter be observed indirectly by using radar backscattering.

I did work with state detection and control of aircraft electric power systems.
In particular, this included implementing state detection under limited sensing conditions to a physical testbed and making a model of and simulating the testbed in Ptolemy II.

We also looked into the problem of sensor placement, and how different sensor placements affect the performance of the state detection.

During my summer internship, I did work focusing on state detection and control of aircraft electric power systems. It was done in the group of Prof. Richard Murray at Caltech,  under the co-supervision of Scott Livingston.


The internship included work on a physical testbed (see picture), implementing state detection under restricted sensing capabilities. 
The work was motivated by the recent trend towards more electric aircraft, from which a larger number of electrical components and an increased architectural complexity of the aircraft electric power systems follows.

We also built a model of the testbed in [Ptolemy II](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/), and looked into the problem of how different sensor placements affect the performance of the state detection.

## Theses

### Master of Science
Linnea Persson, ["Cooperative Control for Landing a Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle on a Ground Vehicle"](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:930987/FULLTEXT01.pdf), February 2016

> __Abstract__ - High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platforms are a type of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). With their relatively easy deployment and independence of a ﬁxed orbit, HALE UAVs have the potential to replace satellites for certain tasks in the future. A challenge with this technology is that the current platforms are too heavy to ﬂy for a long period of time. A suggested method for reducing the weight is to remove the landing gear to instead use alternative methods for take-oﬀ and landing. One such alternative method is to land the UAV on top of a cooperating ground vehicle. In this thesis, the cooperative controller and the experimental setup of such a landing have been investigated. The cooperation between the systems was analyzed and evaluated analytically, through simulations and with ﬂight tests. Using a PID controller for the position alignment and a modiﬁed ﬂare law for the descent, feasibility of the landing was veriﬁed by performing a landing of a Penguin BE ﬁxed-wing UAV on top of a cooperating ground vehicle.

### Bachelor of Science
Linnea Persson, ["Microparticle Ejection and Electromagnetic Scattering in the SCRAP Experiment"](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:753859/FULLTEXT01.pdf), May 2014

> __Abstract__ - This Bachelor Thesis is done within the project SCRAP (SCattering of Radar Waves on Aerosols in Plasmas), which aims to investigate the role of microparticles in the mesosphere. A sounding rocket is to be launched in spring of 2015 containing the experiment. The rocket will eject two free falling units (FFUs) which each subsequently releases a cloud of conductive microparticles into the mesosphere. The particle cloud will interact with the surrounding plasma and can thereafter be observed indirectly by using radar backscattering. In this project two different aspects of the microparticles have been studied. The first one is the way electromagnetic radiation is scattered on them, where known solutions to simplified versions of the problem are adapted in a simple computer program. The second part deals with the particle release mechanism for the FFU. Three different release techniques have been evaluated mainly on the amount of particle agglomeration caused by the releasing. The results show that the method called gunpowder approach has advantages over the others in a number of ways, including the particle dust capacity and the particle separation.
